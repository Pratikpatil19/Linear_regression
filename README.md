# Fuel Efficiency and Iris Dataset Regression Analysis

This project explores two regression tasks:

1. **Fuel Efficiency Prediction:**
   - Uses the 'auto-mpg.csv' dataset to predict fuel efficiency (displacement) based on car attributes.
   - Employs Linear Regression from scikit-learn.
   - Evaluates the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

2. **Iris Dataset Regression:**
   - Uses the 'iris' dataset from seaborn to predict petal width based on petal length.
   - Employs Linear Regression.
   - Evaluates the model using MSE and R-squared.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- seaborn

## Usage

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Load the datasets ('auto-mpg.csv' and 'iris').
3. Run the code cells sequentially.

## Results

The code provides visualizations (scatter plots with regression lines) and performance metrics (MSE and R-squared) for both regression tasks. 

## Notes

- The 'auto-mpg.csv' dataset should be placed in the specified path or adjusted accordingly.
- The code uses train-test splits for model evaluation.
- Refer to the comments in the code for further details.
